## Thema: Carsharing
## First Start
* Set up a MongoDB Database called `carsharing_db` located on port `27017`
  * See https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/ for additional informations
  * I recommend filling the `cars` table with the `cars.json` located in `src\assets\cars.json`
* Do `npm install`
* Do `npm run start:final`
* In another terminal do `npm run start:backend`
## Tests
* Run `npm run test`
